# VLC_NOMA
Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for Indoor Visible Light Communications. We offer a complete review of PD-NOMA-based VLC systems in this study. In addition, we discuss aspects of the PD-NOMA VLC system restrictions and challenges, such as power allocation, clipping effect, MIMO, and security.
